This is a test framework for MDB2 built using PHPUnit.
These tests directly access the MDB2 API - hopefully this framework
should give better feedback as to where or what caused when error are encountered.

Usage:
In order for the tests to work they need to access a database called
"driver_test". This database is created using the MDB2_Schema test or
running the import.schema.php script (edit the db DSN information).
If you have problems running these test or the driver you are using does not yet
provide the necessary methods you may create the "driver_test" database manually:

CREATE TABLE "files" (
  "id" int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  "document" longtext,
  "picture" longblob,
  UNIQUE KEY "lob_id_index_idx" ("id")
);

CREATE TABLE "users" (
  "user_name" varchar(12) default NULL,
  "user_password" char(8) default NULL,
  "subscribed" tinyint(1) default '1',
  "user_id" int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  "quota" decimal(18,2) default '0.00',
  "weight" double default '0',
  "access_date" date default '1970-01-01',
  "access_time" time default '00:00:00',
  "approved" datetime default '1970-01-01 00:00:00',
  UNIQUE KEY "users_id_index_idx" ("user_id")
);

To setup the tests

* requires PHPUnit to be installed

* requires MDB2 (with the given driver) to be installed
  in a php include path.

* copy the file test_setup.php.dist to test_setup.php

* edit test_setup.php. The array $testarray specifies which testcases
  to carry out. $dbarray is an array of databases to test.

* point your browser at test.php or your CLI at clitest.php for the results,
  and then fix the bugs!

* by default test.php/clitest.php will use all tests in the testcases - if
  you want to pick specific tests, use testchoose.php to pick just the
  tests you want to run

Writing tests:

The tests are written using PHPUnit from pear so first make sure you
have the latest stable release, and have read the docs,
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/packages.phpunit.php

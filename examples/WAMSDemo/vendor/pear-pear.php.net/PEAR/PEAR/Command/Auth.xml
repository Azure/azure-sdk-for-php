WARNING: This function is deprecated in favor of using channel-login

Log in to a remote channel server.  If &lt;channel name&gt; is not supplied,
the default channel is used. To use remote functions in the installer
that require any kind of privileges, you need to log in first.  The
username and password you enter here will be stored in your per-user
PEAR configuration (~/.pearrc on Unix-like systems).  After logging
in, your username and password will be sent along in subsequent
operations on the remote server.</doc>
